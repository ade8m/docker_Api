# arq_man
ARQ_MAN hides the complexity of managing containers behind an easy-to-use UI. By removing the need to use the CLI, write YAML or understand manifests, ARQ_MAN makes deploying apps and troubleshooting problems so easy that anyone can do it.

It is composed of an agent that must be installed in the target machine running docker, and a dashboard to manage docker containers with a click of a button.
